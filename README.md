CityGML export plugin
=====================

[CityGML](http://www.citygml.org/) is a general information model and XML coding. It serves for describing models with assigning surface types to models. 

This is a modification of CityGML plugin version 1.8 for use in [SketchUp 2015](http://www.sketchup.com). There are some differences like versions of Ruby, plugin sources paths and so on, between SketchUp 2013 and 2015.
